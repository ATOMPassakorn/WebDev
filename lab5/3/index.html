    <h1>Top Biggest Animals</h1>
    <p>Animals take many shapes and forms and come in a great diversity of sizes, from microscopic to the 30 m long blue
        whale! Whether
        you measure in terms of weight, height or length, there is no denying some animals are huge in comparison to
        others in their class.</p>

            <h1>Blue Whale</h1>
            <p>The Blue whale is the largest animal of all time, reaching a weight of about 198 US tons
                (180 tonnes) and a length of 98 ft (30 m). Their tongues alone can weigh as much as an elephant and
                their hearts as
                much as a car, yet they survive by eating a diet rich in tiny plankton.</p>

            <h1>Colossal Squid</h1>
            <p>
                The size of the colossal squid is often exaggerated, the largest squid recorded was 14 m (45 ft) long.
                They have the largest eyes in the animal kingdom, reaching 25 cm (10 in) in diameter! The colossal squid
                has 3 hearts, something that is not very usual in marine species, but apparently, the more we read, this
                big squid will never stop surprising us. Two of their hearts work to bring enough oxygen to their
                respiratory organs, and the third heart has the function of transporting fully oxygenated blood
                throughout their body. This means that everything has a reason and why, so the reason why they have this
                abnormality, is because of the above, and although it seems strange to us, for them it is essential.</p>

            <h1>African Elephant</h1>
            <p>The largest living land animal is the African Elephant which can weigh up to 6,350 kg (7 tons);
                they typically grow to 35 ft (10.6 m) from trunk to tail and have a shoulder height of 13 ft (4.2 m).
                There are at least two species, the savanna elephant and the forest
                elephant, and they currently cited as venerable in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.</p>

            <h1>Giraffe</h1>
            <p>The Blue whale is the largest animal of all time, reaching a weight of about 198 US tons
                (180 tonnes) and a length of 98 ft (30 m). Their tongues alone can weigh as much as an elephant and

            <h1>Saltwater Crocodile</h1>
            <p>The largest living reptile is the Saltwater Crocodile, growing to an average length of 17 ft (5.2 m),
                although they can reach 21 ft (6.3m) in length and weigh up to ~1,000 lb (453 kg). They are distributed
                widely in brackish and salt waters in parts of India, Asia, and Australia and feed on all animals they
                can get their teeth into, which includes sharks if they get the chance.</p>

            <h1>Whale Shark</h1>
            <p>
                Heading underwater, the largest living fish is the 40 ft (12 m) long Whale Shark. Weighing up to 20
                tons, they are an impressive sight, despite their size, they feed mostly on tiny plankton.</p>

            <h1>Brown Bear</h1>
            <p>
                The position of the largest living land carnivore is shared between Brown Bears and Polar Bears.
                Weighing a whopping 907 kg (1 ton) and reaching up to 10 ft (3 m) tall when standing on their hind legs,
                they’ve definitely earned their spot as the biggest. While you’ll find Brown Bears in the forests and
                mountains of North America, Europe, and Asia, you need to head further north to the Arctic Circle to
                catch a glimpse of Polar Bears, who split their time between the sea and ice and feed mostly on seals.

            <h1>Ostrich</h1>
            <p>The biggest bird on Earth is the common ostrich. A male ostrich can grow up to around 2.75 metres in
                height and weigh up to 156kg. A female ostrich is typically smaller, measuring around 2m at a maximum
                height. The bird is so big, in fact, that it cannot fly but it can run at a top speed of around 70km/h
                in short sprints.</p>
